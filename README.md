# CLASSIFICATION-OF-INDUSTRIAL-MACHINES-SOUNDS
Factory machinery is prone to failure or breakdown, resulting in significant expenses for companies. Hence, there is a rising interest in machine monitoring using different sensors including microphones [1]. In this paper, I will present some techniques of classification as Neural Network and SVM that allow to understand if a particular mechanical machine is malfunctioning or not. In order to do this, It has been used a sub-portion of the MIMII dataset. In MIMII dataset, normal sounds were recorded for different types of industrial machines (i.e., valves, pumps, fans, and slide rails), and to resemble a real-life scenario, various anomalous sounds were recorded (e.g., contamination, leakage, rotating unbalance, and rail damage) [1]. The results achieved in this paper are satisfactory: both NNs and SVMs were able to identify normal and abnormal sounds correctly.
